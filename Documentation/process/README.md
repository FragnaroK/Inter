## Day 1 (one) - Preparation

1. Analysing the project and the goal

   - Which are the requirements?

     - Full dynamic
     - API can be **unreachable** (Display **Error message**)
     - Slef-updating
       > (Should be **efficiently**)
     - Clean, secure and readable code.
     - Document thought processes
     - Consider pagination:
       > [MockAPI - Documentation](https://mockapi.io/docs)
     - Provide instructions to deply applications:
       > Can use _Docker_

   - What they are looking for?

     - Framework skill:
       > I will be using **_ANGULAR_**
     - Scalability
       > I Need more research
     - Git skills
       > I will be using **_Git_** and **_GitHub_**

   - How should I start this project?

     1. Create a _repository_ using **Git** and **GitHub**
     2. Prepare _documentation_ files
     3. **Brainstorm** about design and development tools
     4. Use **Figma** to make a draft of the _dashboard_

## My thought processes

> I'm not really sure if this is the correct way, I **never** did a _dashboard_ and _document my thought processes_ before, so... I will try to do my best.

Today, I started this test doing some _research_ about the requeriments, _thinking_ about which is the goal and how can I _meet_ this challenge (with my _current knowledge_). After that, I did a _Brainstorm_ to organize my ideas and used **_Postman_** to take a look at what kind of data I will have to handle, then I started to design with **_Figma_** the project.

I'm going to do 5 (**Five**) boxes for the _Desktop_ screen:

        1. Total Nodes
        2. Total of New Nodes
        3. Latest Node
        4. List of nodes with a preview showing the space available in each node
        5. A box in which appear details about the node clicked on the list

And, for the _Mobile_ screen:

        - The same as _Desktop_, but the details box appear overlay.

**I will upload a folder with Figma's Prototype.**
